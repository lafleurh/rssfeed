# rssfeed
My version of http://www.noprobweb.com/ version of an rssfeed app

I wanted to use this rssfeed widget after reading a review and looking at it, but I wanted to:
1) allow multiple widgets per page, 
2) read from ATOM feeds, and
3) change the color schemes.

I refactored the code and made these changes. This is my copy for github. Credit goes to http://www.noprobweb.com/ for creating a nice little rssfeed widget.

I also fixed a small bug where the last item was skipped by rewriting the looping logic completely.

See their web site for further documentation: http://www.noprobweb.com/rss_feed_flux_jquery.php

Use div's with different IDs to support multiple feeds.
